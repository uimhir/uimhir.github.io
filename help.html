        <h2>Help for the Irish Number Renderer</h2>
        <p>This page lets users enter a number and see how it would be rendered in
            words in Irish.  Currently four types of numbers are supported:</p>
        <ol><li>Abstract numbers: Numbers used in sequences and arithmetic.</li>
            <li>Object numbers: Numbers used to count things.</li>
            <li>Personal numbers: Numbers used to count people.  These revert to object numbers for 11 or numbers greater than 12.</li>
            <li>Ordinal numbers:  Numbers used to sequence people or things.</li></ol>
        <p>
            This corresponds to sections 9.2-9.5 in the 
            <a href='https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/caighdeanOifigiul/2017/2017-08-03_an-caighdean-oifigiuil-2017_en.pdf'>Caighdean Oifigiul</a>,
            and except as noted below the program attempts to faithfully
        reproduce the rules as given there.</p>
        <p>Future versions will accommodate decimal numbers and fractions as discussed in 9.6 and 9.7.</p>
        <h3> Form values </h3>
        Users simply enter the number for which the word equivalent is desired.  As the number is entered, the
        rendered text will automatically update below the form.  If there are any warnings they will follow the rendered text and
        should be self explanatory.
        If there is an error (e.g., the number cannot be parsed), the error text will be shown instead.  
        <p>The context of the number (i.e., the type as described above) is specified in a selection box.  Simply click on
            the desired option.</p>
        <p> The noun to which the number is to be applied may also be specified.   The nominative singular form of the noun should be given. 
        Normally a noun is expected for Object and Ordinal numbers.  A
        noun is optional for personal numbers, and is usually not expected for abstract numbers.  However the program will allow a noun to be
        specified or omitted in all contexts.  It will simply follow the number for abstract numbers, and be omitted where it should appear if not provided
        for in the other types.</p>
        <p>The only other field in the form is used to control the format of the numbers produced.  Abstract and object numbers have two different formats
            for rendering for values greater than 10,000 and 20 respectively.  There is a traditional format and a modern/simplified format.  The traditional
            format for abstract numbers uses the object format for all but the lowest order triplet, while the 'simple' form uses the same format for
            all triplets and never lenites or uru's the units associated with high order triplets.  Only numbers above 10,000 may use the traditional format.
            The simplified format for object numbers basically uses the simple form for abstract numbers and places the noun at the end.  It may only be used
            for numbers greater than 20 and is also precluded when the number has a single triplet with a value less than 20 and and a number of lower order triplets
            all of which are 0, e.g., 16,000 or 13,000,000,000.
        </p><p>
            If the number is above these minimums and is also greater than
            the value entered in the simple format box, then the number will be rendered in the simpler format.  Otherwise the more traditional format will
            be used.  If there is a zero or negative value in this box it is treated as infinity, so that all numbers will use the traditional formats.
         </p><p>This box should have
            no effect on ordinal numbers.
        <p>
        <h3> Limits </h3>
        Only integer numbers with absolute values less than 10<sup>24</sup>can be rendered.  This limit arises from a lack of words
        corresponding to septillion or greater in Irish, but it would be easy to extend to at least 10<sup>33</sup> (corresponding to
        decillions) or above by transliterating the appropriate words in English.  Both positive and negative values are allowed.
        <p/>
        There are a few modifications to the strict adherence to the Caighdean Oifigiul.  
       <ul><li>The word <i>naidiu</i> is invented as an equivalent to
        zero'th which is now in use in English in programming contexts where counting starting with 0 is common.
        </li>
        <li>Under strict rules the word <i>billiun</i> would sometimes be subject to eclipsis which would render it sounding
            the same as <i>milliun</i>.  To avoid this ambiguity we never eclipse this word (though it is lenited as needed).  E.g.,
            <i>deich mbilliun</i> versus <i>deich milliun</i>.  Note that this is explicitly contradictory to the standard.
        <li>The rules for where a noun is placed in words where the lowest order triplet is 0 and the lowest order non-zero triplet modulo 100 is between
            11 and 19 are unclear (to me at least).  
            E.g., is <i>516,000u bean</i> to be rendered as: <i>cuig chead se mhiliu bean deag</i>, <i>cuig chead se mhiliu deag bean</i> or
            <i>cuig chead se deag miliu bean</i>?  This program chooses the first under the rationale that we treat the <i>miliu bean</i> as a kind of compound noun.
            However there are no examples in the standard that address this.  Clarification of this point would be very much appreciated!
        <li>There are a number of situations in which there are multiple valid forms.  E.g., dara verus dou, daichead versus ceathaireacha and
            the treatment of values one greater than a multiple of 10.  Only one of these forms is shown.
       </ul>
        <h3>Implementation </h3>
        <p>
            This tool is implemented entirely in JavaScript and uses no external resources.  A copy of elements of the dictionary used in teanglann.ie is
            included for some grammar issues.  The program splits the number into digit triplets, reflecting how numbers are rendered in Irish (and English).
            Each triplet is rendered reasonably independently though we let each triplet know its order and if it is the first non-zero and highest order triplet.
            Triplets with all 0's are ignored except for the value 0 itself.
        <p>
            Within each triplet the numbers 0/1/2 are first handled.  There are many special cases addressed here.  Then the numbers 3-99 are looked at and 
            finally three digit values, 100-999.  The three-digit analysis mostly just prepends an appropriate string to the two-digit values.  The 3-99 range is handled
            as a set of ranges: 3-9, 10, 11-19, 20/30/40/..., 2x/3x/4x/.... In the last there are some special cases for x=1.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user interface is a simple React interface using controlled components.  It would be nice to have a Web services version which returned JSON or XML.         
        </p>
        <h3>Use with arguments.</h3>
        Arguments may be appended to the URL to provide a specific initialization to the form. Each argument may be specified using either an English or Irish key word
        and these may be mixed and matched.  If an argument is specified multiple times, the behavior depends on the underlying JavaScript implementation.
        <br/> <br/> <br/>
        <table border="2">
            <tbody>
                <tr><th align="center">Keyword</th><th align="center">Meaning</th></tr>
                <tr><td> number/uimhir</td><td>The number to be rendered</td></tr>
                <tr><td> context/cineal</td><td> The kind of number to be rendered </td></tr>
                <tr><td> noun/ainmfhocal</td><td>The noun to be associated with the number </td></tr>
                <tr><td> minSimple/simplithe</td><td>A minimum above which the simple version should be used when allowed </td></tr>                            
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <br/>
        If the number is specified, then a result should be immediately displayed.  E.g.,
        the URL<pre>

        https://uimhir.github.io?number=2&cineal=orduimhir&noun=bean</code>

</pre>
        should bring up the form filled with
        arguments to give the result <i>an dara bean</i>.
